My name is Shivam Raval, and I am a Computer Scientist with a passion for exploring the intersection of technology and innovation. I hold a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Computer Science from [**Ahmedabad University**](https://ahduni.edu.in/) and [**Arizona State University**](https://www.asu.edu/), respectively.

As a self-motivated individual, I have a strong academic background in computer science and engineering, with experience in various areas such as software engineering, deep learning, natural language processing, and computer vision. My research experience has enabled me to develop innovative and impactful solutions to complex problems, leading to my contributions to publications in the field of computational linguistics.

I possess excellent problem-solving skills, and I am always eager to take on new challenges that allow me to push my boundaries. My experience in cross-functional team collaboration has honed my communication skills, allowing me to effectively communicate ideas and solutions to others.

In summary, I bring a unique blend of technical expertise, research experience, problem-solving skills, and communication skills to the table.
